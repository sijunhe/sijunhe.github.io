Looks like somebody has stumbled upon my blog!

My name is Sijun He. I am currently working on [PaddleNLP](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleNLP) at [Baidu PaddlePaddle](https://baidu.com/). Prior to that, I have had the fortune of working at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/en), [Twitter Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/en.html) and [Autodesk](http://www.autodesk.com/).

The blog documents my journey of learning Machine Learning and NLP from scratch. It will mostly be reading notes and personal projects I have done for work, school or fun. **The blog is a journal for myself.** Whenever I am upset about not making enough progress (happens ALL THE TIME), I read my blog and remind myself of how far I have gone. If you like the blog, I encourage you to create one for yourself.
